Create a form by connecting a Notion database with Generate Notion Forms. We will then automatically generate a form from your selected database. If you want to customize a field, you can of course do that in the form settings. Just open the list of forms and then the form you want to edit.

## Step by step instructions

1. open [Generated Notion Forms](https://generated-notion-forms.com)
2. log in and go to the app dashboard
3. open in the navigation the page 'Databases
4. select the database from which you want to generate a form and click on `generate new Form`.
5. after that the form opens and you can connect e.g. a cloud storage. More about this [here](/docs/storage)
6. copy the URL to send the form.
